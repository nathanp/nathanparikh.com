Welcome to the first week of Foundations. 12 sessions of foundational truth that every Christian should know.

What is Doctrine?

Doctrine simply means “teaching". The word “doctrine” refers to what the Bible teaches about a given subject.

As you carefully study the Bible and assemble its themes, you come to understand what it communicates about an endless variety of subjects—the doctrine of Scripture, for example, which explains what the Bible says about itself; the doctrine of God, which describes what the Bible tells us about the nature, character, and works of God; and the doctrine of salvation, which tells us how God saves people from their sin.

Is Doctrine boring?

Doctrine is like a dirty word among Christians. Stereotype - boring, stoic, serious. But Doctrine is life, life-giving, enriching, good for us. If this is dull, then what is worth to be called exciting?

The people who hanged Christ never, to do them justice, accused Him of being a bore—on the contrary; they thought Him too dynamic to be safe. Christians haven't been persecuted for thousands of years because what we believe is a snooze-fest

God has an invitation, gift for you

The God of the universe who created everything just by speaking, the God who is so powerful, beautiful, and holy that the Bible says no one can see God and live, has given us His doctrine, His truth. God has communicated everything you need to know in order to have godliness, and life, and to be fruitful for me. He invites us to read what He has written, meditate on His Words, Love Him and His Word.

Don't let the world shape you so this looks boring. God Himself has spoken, it can't be boring! We're the problem. When compared to God’s downpour of joy, energy, power, grace and truth - The Rangers are boring. The Cowboys are boring. The world is boring, God can't be boring.

You might think that doctrine isn’t as important as something you can apply directly to your life situation.

You might think, you want something that will help you with your marriage, with your other relationships, with your kids, with your work, with your finances, with direction and purpose in your life.

But consider this…the cement slab your house sits on may be boring, too.

It’s basically a small parking lot with a house on it. How boring is that?

The cement slab may not be as exciting as the kitchen cabinets, the wood paneling, the decorative moldings, ceiling fixtures, the carpet, the new 75” TV you put in it.

But, without that boring cement slab, you cannot build anything that will last.

Without that foundation, none of these more interesting, more exciting, seemingly more useful things can even stand at all.

We need to develop an appreciation for the foundational truths, the doctrines of our faith, because without them, none of the seemingly more interesting, more exciting things, the more applicable things, of our Christian lives, can stand at all

Purpose of this new study

Create a renewed desire within you to go deeper, go beyond casual reading of Scripture, go beyond relying on what you hear on Sunday or Wednesday from your teacher or pastors.

To know what is true about the Bible, God, Yourself, and Salvation

A lot of you here have been following Christ for a long time, but that doesn't mean you stop growing. Disciples never stop growing.
